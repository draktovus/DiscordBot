# Discord Bot

My discord bot.

I am learning how to use github, python, and the discord API in order to make the bot.

It is not neccessary to store the entire virtual environment. Instead, it is better to just make and install what is needed.

```virtualenv .env && source .env/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt```
